MongoDB
Cassandra

Consistency           - same result now or many times
avaliablity           - how robustly our system is stable 
Parition tolerance    - removal of systems or adding new systems how well the systems behave with each other

- it depends what I want in website / app 
if I want availability and consistency I choose , i need Mysql

              MongoDB - is a NOSQL database
