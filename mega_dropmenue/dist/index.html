                What I find remarkable is that this text has been the industry's standard
                 dummy text ever since some printer in the 1500s took a galley of 
                 type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book; 
                 it has survived not only four centuries of letter-by-letter 
                 resetting but even the leap into electronic typesetting,
                  essentially unchanged except for an occasional . 
                  It's ironic that when the then-understood Latin was scrambled,
            </p>
            <p>So how did the classical Latin become so incoherent? According to McClintock, 
                a 15th century typesetter likely scrambled part of Cicero's De Finibus in order 
                to provide placeholder text to mockup various fonts for a type specimen book.
                It's difficult to find examples of lorem ipsum in use before Letraset 
                made it popular as a dummy text in the 1960s, although McClintock 
                says he remembers coming across the lorem ipsum passage in a book of old
                 metal type samples. So far he hasn't relocated where he once saw the
                  passage, but the popularity of Cicero in the 15th century supports the theory that the filler text has been used for centuries.
