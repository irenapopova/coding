# CSS Grid Periodic Table

My attempt to learn CSS Grid by creating a periodic table of elements using [CSS Grid Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout).

## HTML structure

All elements of the periodic table are in `<div>` elements inside a `<section>`. There are 119 HTML elements in total (118 elements + an `<aside>` for the legend contents).

There are no wrapping elements for periods (rows) and groups (columns). The purpose of this is to produce the desired layout using CSS Grid Layout.
