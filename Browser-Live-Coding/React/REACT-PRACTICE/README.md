### React Practices

#### Deployment

- npm run build

(every time when add changes to json file to run the command)
build automatically takes the homepage

#### install package

npm i gh-pages

### start the projects

npm start

Note:
"predeploy": "npm run build",  runs first 
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"

    always after changes
