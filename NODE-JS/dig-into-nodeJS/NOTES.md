#### Node.js Module Types

### Node.js includes three types of modules:

Core Modules
Local Modules
Third Party Modules

Node is all about I/O. Node is all about modeling I/O in an efficient way.

(node - the core usage  which is actually all about modelling I/O in an efficient way)

### Important 
without understanding I/O bound tasks communications on deeper level no chance of getting to  node ,  and asynchronous event loop is  the compelling model for I/O bound tasks, and that is the sweet spot of node js

##### How node connects to the environment around it?
Have to understand a standard for I/O and system integration, and system-level-task calling, called - P-O-S-I-X.

#### POSIX is essentially  a way  that C-style programs integrate with Linux-style operating systems. POSIX is standard I/O subsystem.

#### What is a Standard I/O ?

Standard I/O is a set of three sreams that model input and output to a program.
