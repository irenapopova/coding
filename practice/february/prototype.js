// PROTOTYPE OBJECT
// Prototype Inheritance

// a shared object / sharable objects, they share their
// properties and their methods, so I can access those members via the instances
// that I created;
// how to attach a prototype object to the constructor object
// this word is based on context, it is all about HOW it is invoked;
// this key word needs context, if I point to this , what I am pointing to 

// Prototype Constructors

// javascript treats FUNCTIONS as Callable Objects

/**
 * prototypes are just shared objects, they allow me to share properties and methods
 * across a range of objects,
 * the prototype Object is attached to the callable object, 
 * which is the constructor and when I construct an object from 
 * that constructor , it is automatically linked to 
 * that callable object prototype, that link is dynamically 
 * established and then I have one copy and I can use 
 * this context to go back out to the instance level
