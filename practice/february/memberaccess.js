// functions are also called callable objects, 
//they have their own scope , they have their own execution context;

// I can have function inside of function, object inside of an object 
// callable object inside of callable object 
// and when I invoke each one I am in fact adding to the STACK

// Outer Execution Environment is for execution to happen
// Execution stack or Main Tread

// functions are callable objects 
// callable objects have scopes just like regular objects 
// callable objects are closure where any sort of symbol that is created 
// inside the execution stack as long as there is another callable object
// in there still in the execution stack, it keeps the symbol, 
// it encloses everything together and it keeps those symbols
// whilst we are executing all those instructions on the execution stack
// or the main thread then once all of it has been executed it returns the 
// the final values and it does all of its operations; 
// it then clears out the symbols that I can no longer reference 
// in my program, once I have executed these list of instructions
// I have done what I need to do with these instructions 
// they are thrown in the bin, and I have garbage collection 
// as well that deletes out those symbols so I am not wasting memory

// in javascript we are writing statements
