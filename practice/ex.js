// EXERCISE 9
//Make a variable for firstName and age and give each variable values.
//Create an if/else statement to check whether the person’s age is less than 13.
//If so, print “firstName is a child”. If the age is equal to or more
//13 and less than 20, print “firstName is a teenager”.
//If the person’s age is equal to 20 and less than 30, then print “firstName is a young adult”.
//If none of these conditions apply, print “firstName is a adult”.

let firstName = "Mark";
let Age = 11;
if (Age < 13) {
  console.log(`${firstName} is child `);
}
